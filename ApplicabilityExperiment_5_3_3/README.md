## TFuzz

We apply `ConfTainter` to implement a prototype tool, **TFuzz**, for configuration fuzzing.

The repository includes the following artifacts:

```TFuzz.cpp``` : The source code of sub-module, recording the basic blocks tainted by configurations.

```result``` : The details of the four hangs and crashes.
