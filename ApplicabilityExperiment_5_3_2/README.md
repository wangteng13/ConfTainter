## TCub

We apply `ConfTainter` to implement a prototype tool, **TCub**, for configuration update bug detection.

The repository includes the following artifacts:

```TCub.cpp``` : The source code of of sub-module, recording the values of configuration-related variables (scaling ConfTainter).

```Instrumentation``` : The source code of instrumentation with the configuration-related variables.

```Tester``` : The source code of conducting metamorphic test.

```result``` : The results of TCub on both known bugs and unknown bugs.
